## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- jQuery
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Aria accessibility for svg images (see edited svg image in github)
- More regular expression practice. I know a bit and I've studied it on and off over the years.
- I could re-use a regular expression from another one of my frontmentor projects to save time, so this challenge wasn't too bad, plus how to add error icons.

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Sass/SCSS. For now.  In time I will go re-learn React ect, or what's needed.

### Useful resources

- [Regular expression for password](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19605150/regex-for-password-must-contain-at-least-eight-characters-at-least-one-number-a) - I know the password was not required to be correct, but I wanted to get more practice and understanding of regular expressions
- [Aria](https://a11y-101.com/development/svg) - Aria accesibility for SVG images.
